How-To-Use-Generator-Wizard:

This package contains an Unity Editor extension that adds new option to the editor menu:

  Menu
    GameObject
      Create Other
        Procedural Creations
          Plane

Selecting this option will present a Wizard dialog with parameters to control the plane you create.

Once you press the Create button a new object named "Plane" will appear in the Heirarchy and the object will be selected.

How-To-Use-Generator-Component:

For a more interactive experience you can use the PlaneGenerator component:

	1) Create Empty game object
	2) Drag the Plane/PlaneGenerator script onto your object's Inspector panel
	   to add the component to your object.
	3) Edit the properties to describe your plane.
	4) Notice yellow outlines show your plane structure.
	5) Press the Generate button at the bottom of the PlaneGenerator component.
	6) Continue to tweak the propeties and re-generate your plane.
	7) When you're done you can remove the component or keep it for reference.

Enjoy.
