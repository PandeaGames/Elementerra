Models, Textures and Shader by Hristo Ivanov

Amazingly easy to setup shader that will add realistic snow placement on any object.
Snowshade is a shader that will let you have snow on top of any surface regardless of it's world orientation.
No longer do you need to create a large number of asset variations for snow-covered objects.
With this package you can be sure you'll always have your snow realistically placed on the surface you want.

The package includes free to use textures and models provided by Kris Development.

HOW TO USE:
1. Create a new material and assign the shader (Shader > Wassaby Pulse > Snow Standard)
2. Put textures of your choice in the designated slots.
3. Select color for your base texture and the snow (you could use the shader for simulating desert sand)
4. Drag the property slider to fit your needs.
5. Assign the material to the desired mesh in your scene.
That's all you need to do.
Now regardless of the orientation of your objects, they can all share the same material and always have top-side snow.
